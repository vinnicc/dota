# Dota [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/dota.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/dota) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vinnicc/dota.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vinnicc/dota) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/vinnicc/dota/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/vinnicc/dota) [![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/vinnicc/dota/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/vinnicc/dota/coverage)

`dota` is a Ruby client for the [Dota 2 WebAPI](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/WebAPI#Dota_2).

## Requests

Valve provides a `GetSupportedAPIList` endpoint that returns all the available endpoints in their API you can use, along with the parameters they accept. The following are supported by `dota`:

- GetLeagueListing
- GetMatchDetails
- GetMatchHistory
- GetFriendList
- GetHeroes
- GetGameItems
- GetRarities
- GetTeamInfoByTeamID
- GetLiveLeagueGames
- GetScheduledLeagueGames

Unsupported endpoints (including `GetSupportedAPIList`) can still be queried via [custom requests](#custom-requests) using `Dota.api.get`.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dota', '~> 0.0.21'

```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it in your local repository:

    $ gem install dota -v 0.0.21

## Usage

Get your Steam API key [here](http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) and make sure the gem is configured to use it. If you're using Rails, this might go in an initializer like `config/initializers/dota.rb`.

```ruby
Dota.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = ENV.fetch("STEAM_API_KEY")

  # Set API version (defaults to "v1")
  # config.api_version = "v1"
end
```

Then use the client:

```ruby
api = Dota.api

api.heroes(43)                   # => (Cached) A single hero - "Death Prophet"
api.heroes                       # => (Cached) All heroes

api.friends(76561198052976237)   # => All friends of user
```

#### Custom Requests

For the unsupported endpoints, you can use `api.get`. For example, the following code is similar to `api.matches(789645621)` except it will return the raw JSON payload instead of an array of `Dota::Match`es.

```ruby
api.get("IDOTA2Match_570", "GetMatchDetails", match_id: 789645621)
```

Setting `api_version` here also overrides the current configuration:

```ruby
api.get("IDOTA2Match_570", "GetMatchDetails", match_id: 789645621, api_version: "v1")
```

### API Objects

#### Heroes

```ruby
hero.id        # Integer, ID of the hero
hero.name      # String, Name of the hero
hero.image_url # String, URL of the hero portrait
```

```

#### Teams

team.name            # String, Name of the team
team.tag             # String, Abbreviation tag of the team

```

#### Matches

Caveat: Getting a list of matches via `api.matches` will call [GetMatchHistory](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/WebAPI/GetMatchHistory) which has very few attributes for the matches returned (obviously for performance reasons), as opposed to getting info about a particular match via `api.matches(id)` which will instead call [GetMatchDetails](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/WebAPI/GetMatchDetails). In both cases, the matches returned will be instances of `Dota::API::Match`. In the future, there will be subclasses to distinguish the two.

When an instance method in a `Dota::API::Match` class returns `nil`, it most likely means the endpoint called doesn't provide it yet.
